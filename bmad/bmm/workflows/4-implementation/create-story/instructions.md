# Create Story - Workflow Instructions (Spec-compliant, non-interactive by default)

```xml
<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>This workflow creates or updates the next user story from epics/PRD and architecture context, saving to the configured stories directory and optionally invoking Story Context.</critical>
<critical>DOCUMENT OUTPUT: Concise, technical, actionable story specifications. Use tables/lists for acceptance criteria and tasks.</critical>

<workflow>

  <step n="1" goal="Load config and initialize">
    <action>Resolve variables from config_source: story_dir (dev_story_location), output_folder, user_name, communication_language. If story_dir missing and {{non_interactive}} == false ‚Üí ASK user to provide a stories directory and update variable. If {{non_interactive}} == true and missing, HALT with a clear message.</action>

    <action>Build a prioritized document set for this epic:
      1) tech_spec_file (epic-scoped)
      2) epics_file (acceptance criteria and breakdown)
      3) prd_file (business requirements and constraints)
      4) architecture_file (architecture constraints)
      5) Architecture docs under docs/ and output_folder/: tech-stack.md, unified-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, testing-strategy.md, backend-architecture.md, frontend-architecture.md, data-models.md, database-schema.md, rest-api-spec.md, external-apis.md (include if present)

    <action>Find the FIRST story (by reading in order from top to bottom) where:
      - Key matches pattern: number-number-name (e.g., "1-2-user-auth")

All stories are either already drafted or completed.

**Options:**
1. Run sprint-planning to refresh story tracking
2. Load PM agent and run correct-course to add more stories
3. Check if current sprint is complete

    <action>From architecture and architecture docs: extract constraints, patterns, component boundaries, and testing guidance relevant to the extracted ACs. ONLY capture information that directly informs implementation of this story.</action>
    <action>Derive a clear user story statement (role, action, benefit) grounded strictly in the above sources. If ambiguous and {{non_interactive}} == false ‚Üí ASK user to clarify. If {{non_interactive}} == true ‚Üí generate the best grounded statement WITHOUT inventing domain facts.</action>

  <step n="6" goal="Assemble acceptance criteria and tasks">

**Story Details:**
- Story ID: {{story_id}}
- Story Key: {{story_key}}
- File: {{story_file}}
- Status: drafted (was backlog)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The following workflows are context-intensive. It's recommended to clear context and restart the SM agent before running the next command.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the drafted story in {{story_file}}
2. **[RECOMMENDED]** Run `story-context` to generate technical context XML and mark story ready for development (combines context + ready in one step)
3. Or run `story-ready` to manually mark the story ready without generating technical context
